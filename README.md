## Visualizing Data Project – Part 1

This project explores the state of **water access** across communities in **Maji Ndogo**, highlighting:

- Infrastructure issues  
- Queue wait times  
- Spatial accessibility disparities  
- **Gender inequality** in water collection  

The analysis uses real survey data enhanced with **AI-based image classification**, identifying the demographic composition of water queues.


 📌 Project Overview

Field surveyors collected water source data and queue observations at multiple locations in Maji Ndogo.  
Using **machine learning**, photographs taken onsite were analyzed to detect and classify:

- Men 🧍‍♂️
- Women 🧍‍♀️
- Children 🧒

This revealed who carries the burden of collecting water — **women and children**, especially in unsafe hours.

The insights are presented using **interactive Power BI dashboards**, designed to support:

- National & local government planning
- NGO & donor infrastructure funding decisions
- Strategic initiatives for **gender equity** in resource access


 🎯 Key Insights

- **31%** have in-home taps — but **45% are dysfunctional**
- **18%** use wells — only **28% are clean**
- Queues often exceed **120 minutes**

⏱ Queue Time Peaks  
- Longest: **Mornings, evenings, Saturdays**
