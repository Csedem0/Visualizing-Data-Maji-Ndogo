## Visualizing Data Project – Part 1

This project explores the state of **water access** across communities in **Maji Ndogo**, highlighting:

- Infrastructure issues  
- Queue wait times  
- Spatial accessibility disparities  
- **Gender inequality** in water collection  

The analysis uses real survey data enhanced with **AI-based image classification**, identifying the demographic composition of water queues.


 📌 Project Overview

Field surveyors collected water source data and queue observations at multiple locations in Maji Ndogo.  
Using **machine learning**, photographs taken onsite were analyzed to detect and classify:

- Men 🧍‍♂️
- Women 🧍‍♀️
- Children 🧒

This revealed who carries the burden of collecting water — **women and children**, especially in unsafe hours.

The insights are presented using **interactive Power BI dashboards**, designed to support:

- National & local government planning
- NGO & donor infrastructure funding decisions
- Strategic initiatives for **gender equity** in resource access


 🎯 Key Insights

From SQL analysis and updated datasets:

- Majority of citizens rely on **rural water sources**
- **43%** use **shared taps** — up to **2000 people sharing one**
- **31%** have in-home taps — but **45% are dysfunctional**
- **18%** use wells — only **28% are clean**
- Queues often exceed **120 minutes**

⏱ Queue Time Peaks  
- Longest: **Mornings, evenings, Saturdays**  
- Shortest: **Wednesdays & Sundays**

👩‍🍼 Gender + Age Burden  
- Women & children dominate queue participation  
- Men contribute more **only on weekends**

## Visualizing Data Project – Part 2  

This project is the **second phase** of the Maji Ndogo Water Access Visualization initiative.  
While **Part 1** focused on understanding *where* and *why* water access problems exist, **Part 2** focuses on **what should be done next**.

Using data-driven prioritization, this phase translates insights into **actionable infrastructure improvement strategies** supported by clear visual analytics.


📌 Project Objective

The goal of Part 2 is to support **decision-making** by:

- Identifying **priority communities** for intervention  
- Evaluating **water source conditions and failure risks**  
- Supporting **budget allocation and planning**
- Ensuring **equitable access**, especially for vulnerable populations  

This phase bridges the gap between **analysis** and **implementation**.


🔍 Project Overview

Building on the findings from Part 1, this project:

- Integrates water source condition data
- Evaluates functionality and reliability of infrastructure
- Visualizes **repair vs. replacement needs**
- Highlights communities with **high queue times and unsafe access**
- Supports **evidence-based prioritization**

Interactive Power BI dashboards are used to communicate findings clearly to stakeholders such as:

- Government agencies
- NGOs and humanitarian organizations
- Infrastructure planners and funders


🎯 Key Analytical Focus Areas

- **Broken vs. functional water sources**
- **Communities with extreme queue times**
- **High-risk water points (wells, shared taps, rural sources)**
- **Repair urgency vs. replacement necessity**
- **Resource allocation efficiency**

## Visualizing Data Project – Part 3  
From Planning to Execution: Monitoring Water Infrastructure Improvements in Maji Ndogo

This project represents the **Part 3** of the Maji Ndogo Water Access Visualization series.  
While **Part 1** focused on understanding the water access problem and **Part 2** prioritized interventions, **Part 3** tracks **implementation progress, costs, and outcomes** of water infrastructure improvements.

The project emphasizes **accountability, monitoring, and impact evaluation** through clear and actionable data visualizations.


📌 Project Objective

The primary goal of Part 3 is to:

- Monitor **ongoing and completed infrastructure improvements**
- Track **budgeted vs. actual improvement costs**
- Evaluate **progress across communities**
- Support **transparent reporting** to stakeholders
- Ensure investments translate into **real improvements in water access**

This phase ensures that planning decisions result in **measurable impact**.


🔍 Project Overview

Building on the prioritized improvement plans from Part 2, this project:

- Tracks implementation status by location
- Compares **planned vs. completed upgrades**
- Visualizes **financial efficiency**
- Highlights communities still at risk
- Enables performance monitoring at national and local levels

Power BI dashboards are used to communicate progress clearly to:

- Government oversight bodies  
- NGOs and development partners  
- Project managers and funders  

🎯 Key Focus Areas

- **Improvement status** (Not started, In progress, Completed)
- **Budgeted vs. actual costs**
- **Community-level progress tracking**
- **Remaining high-risk water sources**
- **Implementation performance indicators**
